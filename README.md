# PythonBuiltinExtensions
Simple module that consists of code that extends pythons built-in modules with added functionality that I tend to use often.

## Integration Extensions in your project
The quick and dirty way to integrate the extensions in your project is to juust download the extensions.py file 
and place it in your project repository. If you want to make it available to any project that is using your virtual
environment or install it directly to your global python install you can install it from the github repository via
pip.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/superadm1n/PythonBuiltinExtensions.git
```
